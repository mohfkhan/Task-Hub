This project was my first introduction to integrating bootstrap in web applications. I explored CSS specificity and manipulating heights of elements to account for scrolling when tasks exceeded a certain limit.

I also used DOM manipulation and event listeners to respond to user input and display tasks, as well as marking them as complete and deleting. I learned how to save the user's data in their local storage and render them on websiteÂ loading.
